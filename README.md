Dynamic pricing has become a cornerstone of modern e-commerce, enabling businesses to adjust prices in real-time based on market demand, competitor actions, and inventory levels. Traditional pricing strategies—such as cost-plus or rule-based pricing—often fail to account for rapidly changing market conditions, leading to missed revenue opportunities or customer attrition. With the rise of AI and machine learning, data-driven pricing optimization has emerged as a powerful alternative, capable of adapting to complex, real-world scenarios.
